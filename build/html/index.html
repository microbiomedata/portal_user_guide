<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The pilot NMDC Data Portal (<a class="reference external" href="https://data.microbiomedata.org">https://data.microbiomedata.org</a>) provides a resource for consistently processed multi-omics data that is integrated to enable search, access, analysis, and download. Open-source bioinformatics workflows are used to process raw multi-omics data and produce interoperable and reusable annotated data from metagenome, metatranscriptome, metaproteome, metabolome, and natural organic matter characterizations. The NMDC Data Portal offers several search and navigation components, and data can be downloaded through the graphical user interface using an ORCiD authentication, with associated download metrics, or retrieved through available RESTful APIs. All multi-omics data are available under a Creative Commons 4.0 license, which enables public use with attribution, as outlined in the NMDC Data Use Policy (<a class="reference external" href="https://microbiomedata.org/nmdc-data-use-policy">https://microbiomedata.org/nmdc-data-use-policy</a>). This first iteration of the NMDC Data Portal was released in March 2021, and will continue to expand its data hostings and functionality on a quarterly basis. Associated release notes and updated user guides will accompany each quarterly release. Available code on  the NMDC GitHub repository at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/microbiomedata">https://github.com/microbiomedata</a>.</p>

<h1>User-Centered Design Process<a class="headerlink" href="#user-centered-design-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The NMDC is a resource designed together with and for the scientific community. We have engaged in extensive user research through interviews and direct collaboration with the scientific community that have informed the design, development, and display of data through the NMDC Data Portal. This methodology (1) enables the scientific community to provide feedback, iterative and continuous improvement of our systems, and ensures that our systems enable a high level of scientific productivity. Feedback collected from the scientific community during early iterations of the Data Portal can be linked to the features and design directions found in the current release. Our community-centered design approach ensures that the NMDC can evolve with the needs of the microbiome research community, but will also be important for uncovering creative design solutions, clarifying expectations, reducing redesign, and perhaps most importantly, enabling shared ownership (2) of the NMDC. We hope that this inclusive approach will enable us to expand our engagements with the microbiome research community and the utility of the NMDC Data Portal.</p>

<h1>Available Studies &amp; Data<a class="headerlink" href="#available-studies-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For the October 2021 NMDC Data Portal release, the data hostings include 7 studies, 638 biosamples, and 5 data types from a breadth of environmental microbiomes, spanning river sediments, subsurface shale carbon reservoirs, plant-microbe associations, and temperate and tropical soils. Specifics are as follows:</p>
<div class="section" id="studies">
<h2>Studies<a class="headerlink" href="#studies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As the NMDC Data Portal is a pilot infrastructure, incoming projects for which study information and curated environmental metadata become available is first validated and loaded with a flag (Omics data coming soon) before processed instrumentation data is integrated into the portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standards">
<h2>Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The NMDC team works closely with several standards groups and organizations. We have adopted the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC) Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS) templates (3). This provides a standard data dictionary of sample descriptors (e.g., location, biome, altitude, depth) organized into seventeen environmental packages (<a class="reference external" href="https://gensc.org/mixs">https://gensc.org/mixs</a>) for sequence data. The NMDC team has mapped fields used to describe samples in the GOLD database to MIxS version 5 (v5) elements. In addition, we are adopting the MIxS standards for sequence data types (e.g., sequencing method, pcr primers and conditions, etc.), and are leveraging standards and controlled vocabularies developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative (4), the National Cancer Institute’s Proteomic Data Commons (https://pdc.cancer.gov/data-dictionary/dictionary.html), and the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (5) for mass spectrometry data types (e.g., ionization mode, mass resolution, scan rate, etc.).</p>
<div class="section" id="mixs-environmental-packages">
<h3><em>MIxS environmental packages</em><a class="headerlink" href="#mixs-environmental-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The GSC has developed standards for describing genomic and metagenomic sequences, and the environment from which a biological sample originates. These “<a class="reference external" href="https://gensc.org/mixs/">Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence</a>” (MIxS) packages provides standardized sample descriptors (e.g., location, environment, elevation, altitude, depth, etc.) for 17 different sample environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environment-ontology-envo">
<h3><em>Environment Ontology (EnvO)</em><a class="headerlink" href="#environment-ontology-envo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>EnvO is a community-led ontology that represents environmental entities such as biomes, environmental features, and environmental materials. These EnvO entities are the recommended values for several of the mandatory terms in the MIxS packages, often referred to as the “MIxS triad”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="genomes-online-database-gold">
<h3><em>Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD)</em><a class="headerlink" href="#genomes-online-database-gold" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GOLD is an open-access repository of genome, metagenome, and metatranscriptome sequencing projects with their associated metadata. Biosamples (defined as the physical material collected from an environment) are described using a five-level ecosystem classification path that goes from ecosystem down to the type of environmental material that describes the sample.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="omics-data">
<h2>Omics Data<a class="headerlink" href="#omics-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A suite of omics processing data can be generated from available biosamples, and the value of associating these data through a common sample source enables researchers to probe function. The NMDC data schema offers an approach to link omics processing runs to their source biosample (for example, multiple organic matter characterizations can be generated from a single sample through extraction with various solvents, eg, chloroform, methanol, and water fractionation). Below outlines the various omics data currently available through the portal.</p>
<div class="section" id="metagenomes">
<h3><em>Metagenomes.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#metagenomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Illumina-sequenced shotgun metagenome data undergo pre-processing, error correction, assembly, structural and functional annotation, and binning leveraging the JGI’s production pipelines (6), along with an additional read-based taxonomic analysis component. Standardized outputs from the read QC, read-based analysis, assembly, annotation, and binning are available for search and download for 123 metagenomes on the NMDC Data Portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metatranscriptomes">
<h3><em>Metatranscriptomes.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#metatranscriptomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Illumina-sequenced shotgun reads from cDNA library undergo pre-processing and error correction in the same way as described above in the metagenome workflow with additional steps to filter  ribosomal reads. High-quality reads are then assembled into transcripts using MEGAHIT (7), annotated using the annotation module described in the metagenome workflow, and the high-quality reads are mapped back to the annotated transcripts using HISAT2 (8) and then processed to calculate the number of reads mapped per feature using FeatureCount  (9) and RPKM calculations per feature using edgeR (10). Results from read QC, assembly, and annotation are available for search and download for 45 metatranscriptomes on the NMDC Data Portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metaproteomes">
<h3><em>Metaproteomes.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#metaproteomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Data-dependent mass spectrometry raw data files are first converted to mzML, using MSConvert (11). Peptide identification is achieved using MSGF+ (12) and the associated metagenomic information in the FASTA file. Peptide identification false discovery rate is controlled using a decoy database approach. Intensity information is extracted using MASIC (13) and combined with protein information. Protein annotation information is obtained from the associated metagenome annotation output. Standardized outputs for quality control, and peptide and protein-level quantitative data are available for search and download for 38 metaproteomes on the NMDC Data Portal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metabolomes">
<h3><em>Metabolomes.</em><a class="headerlink" href="#metabolomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolomics workflow (metaMS) developed by leveraging EMSL’s CoreMS mass spectrometry software framework allows target and semi-target data analysis of metabolomics data (14).  The raw data is parsed into coreMS data structure and undergoes all the steps of signal processing (signal noise reduction, m/z based chromatogram peak deconvolution, abundance threshold calculation, peak picking) and molecular identification, including the molecular search using a metabolites standard compound library, spectral similarity calculation, and similarity score calculation (15), all in a single step. The putative metabolite annotation data is available to download for 34 metabolomes on the NMDC Data Portal. Data dependent LC-MS based workflows are currently under development. Additionally, it should be noted that all available data derives from exploratory, untargeted analysis and is semi-quantitative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="natural-organic-matter-characterization-nom">
<h3><em>Natural Organic Matter Characterization (NOM).</em><a class="headerlink" href="#natural-organic-matter-characterization-nom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Direct Infusion Fourier Transform mass spectrometry (DI FT-MS) data undergoes signal processing and molecular formula assignment leveraging EMSL’s CoreMS framework (14). Raw time domain data is transformed into the <em>m/z</em> domain using Fourier Transform and Ledford equation (16). Data is denoised followed by peak picking, recalibration using an external reference list of known compounds, and searched against a dynamically generated molecular formula library with a defined molecular search space. The confidence scores for all the molecular formula candidates are calculated based on the mass accuracy and fine isotopic structure, and the best candidate assigned as the highest score. The molecular formula characterization table is available to download for 946 natural organic matter characterizations on the NMDC Data Portal.</p>
